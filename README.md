# Evolve (EWB!) super pom

The super pom for Zepben apps.

## Updating

While the major version is <1.0.0, changes should bump the minor (y in x.y.z) version number manually
(CI does not do this automatically like other Zepben repos).
If you have fixed a bug in the pom you can probably just increment the z number, but while
we are less than 1.0.0 it probably doesn't make much difference...
